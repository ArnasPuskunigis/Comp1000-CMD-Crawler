# Arnas Puskunigis - 2023 - Comp1000 - CMD Crawler

This is a C# project which I developed as coursework for the first semester of my computer science for games development degree at the University of Plymouth
It is a command line dungeon crawler where the player has to navigate the map in order to collect coins and reach the exit while avoiding monsters.
